# Intro_To_Assembly
Introduction to Computer Architecture - CSC 35 Sacramento State University 

In this course we took the opportunity to learn assembly level machine architecture, addressing modes, subroutine linkage, 
polled input/output, interrupts, high- level language interfacing, macros and pseudo operations. I created the repo to 
document my growth throughout the course. I have also included a link to the professors documentation for the CSC35 library
that was used heavily throughout the course. Overall, it was an exciting course and I cant wait to put my knowledge to 
practice as soon as possible.
